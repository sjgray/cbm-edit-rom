; PET/CBM EDIT ROM - Keyboard Scan - Business Keyboards
; ================
; Standard Business Keyboard scanner. Requires one keyboard table.
;
; OPTIONS: KEYBOARD=7 modifies scanner for CBM-II keyboard (16x6 matrix)

;--------------- Scan Keyboard (scnkey)
; NOTE: The keyboard ROW select is reset to zero in IRQ routine

}

;-------------- STOP KEY FIX
; In the PET KERNAL there is code to check for the STOP key but is hard coded for N and B keyboards.
; This fix puts the proper value ($EF) into STKEY ($9B) when the relocated STOP key is pressed.
; NOTE: Must investigate further!

!if KEYBOARD > 1 {			; Compensate for STOP key not in standard position
		CMP #3			; Is keycode "3" (STOP key)?

		STA STKEY		; store it
