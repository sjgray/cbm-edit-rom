FOLDERS:

\binaries       - Collections of binary files. See README(s) for info.
\config-cbmrom  - Config files for original CBM binaries.
\config-custom  - Config files for your Builds.
\disassemblies  - Disassemblies of original Edit ROMs and other related code.
\docs           - Related info
\software       - Support software and disk images

FILES:

!*.asm		- Config files. Replaces "edit.asm" file so you can have multiple settings files.

make.bat	- Type "make" to assemble A CUSTOM editor rom using "!custom.asm" settings file.
maker.bat	- As above but also make a report file.
makecbm.bat     - Builds specific CBM binary version by filename, and verifies match to original.
makecbmrom.bat  - Builds specific CBM binary by CBMROM number, and verifies match to original.

editrom.asm	- Logic to assemble code in LOWER 2K area and determine if HI area is required.

editrom40.asm	- CODEBASE 0 - 40 column, 2K ROM.
editrom80.asm   - CODEBASE 1 - 80 column, 2K ROM.
editrom82.asm   - CODEBASE 2 - LOWER area. 80 column, 4K ROM, DIN editor.
editrom82ext.asm- CODEBASE 2 - UPPER area.

edit40hi.asm	- Logic to assemble CODEBASE 0 to UPPER 2K area, including IO area.
edit80hi.asm	- Logic to assemble CODEBASE 1 to UPPER 2K area, including IO area.
edit82hi.asm	- Logic to assemble CODEBASE 2 to UPPER 2K area, including IO area.

ext*		- Code for CODEBASE 2 extended code in UPPER 2K area (subsections).
crt*		- Files to define screen settings. Written to CRTC controller chip.
keyscan         - Keyboard scanning code.
keyboard-*	- Keyboard matrix tables.
