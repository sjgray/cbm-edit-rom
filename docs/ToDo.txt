PET/CBM EDIT ROM PROJECT - TODO List
======================== - TODO.TZT  - Updated 2025-09-08

- Continue to add memory variable descriptions (see Commodore's CBM-II source for 'official' labels)
- Analyze extended keyboard scanning routine. Have special codes been modified?
- Document added screen codes for character set switching

- Update extended keyboard matrix tables
	- SHIFT tables need fixing (except for DIN, which is the template)
	- Do we need to add additional tables for "C=" (Commodore Key)?

- ColourPET features:
	- Some ESC codes not working.
	- Some C128 colour codes conflict with PET/CBM codes (ie: SHIFT-ESC)
	- ColourPET uses ZP variables in TAPE area. Do not use TAPE with ColourPET or find alternate storage locations.

- CBM-II keyboard support will require hardware modification.
- Sort out DIN keyboard matrix variations.

- Investigate CRTC parameters for use with RGB/CGA to VGA adapters. Herv  connected his PET to a
  GB8220 board and says the sync width needs adjusting to get a stable picture. His 8032 CRTC
  is initialized with the following registers: 63,40,53,33,33,7,25,32,0,8

NOTE:
      Colour RAM has been relocated to $8800 and hardware will be updated so that 40/80 columns
      can be supported with fixed colour ram locations

Requests:
---------

- Toggle internal/external monitor settings. Hardware control for internal monitor shutoff


Bugs:
-----
- When scrolling a window (using ESC-T for Top) it also scrolls the first character on the line (outside the window)
